## 📋 Project Management (Jira)

We used **Jira** to manage the project professionally:

- Created **Epics** and **Tasks**
- Assigned tasks to team members
- Used a **Kanban Board** with:
  - To Do
  - In Progress
  - Done
- Tracked progress and priorities
- Ensured clear task ownership and workflow
